# Project Blocks

Blocks is a fun, interactive game similar to Tetris. You are presented with a grid of square cells and a set of some number of pieces formed from configurations of square, cell-sized blocks, which you try to arrange in order to cover empty cells of the grid. After each piece is placed, any rows and columns of the grid that have become completely filled are cleared. After you place all the pieces in the hand, it is refilled with the same number of pieces as before. Play continues until none of the pieces in the hand can fit anywhere on the board.
